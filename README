My shell environment.
I use it on both ubuntu and osx. 

On osx, set sane defaults by running osx.sh

Information and remarks
- If you have settings you want for only one machine (or simply not committed), files under bash/local will be read automatically
- If a ~/bin directory is found, it is added to the PATH
- some vim plugins require +ruby, which is not installed by default in osx (at least in 10.6). Either recompile or create an executable file 'vi' in ~/bin that will run 'mvim -v' (if you use macvim). 


# Iterm
Delete a word - Send Hex Codes - 0x1b 0x08 or 0x17 (0x1b 0x08 stops at dots , it's better for code)
Delete a line - Send Hex Codes - 0x15
